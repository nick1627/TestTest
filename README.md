# TestTest
Learning how to test

Types of test:
Unit testing: test single method, function, class etc.
    Test normal data, boundary data and erroneous data
Basic functionality testing: are buttons working?  Does it crash on use? (program as a whole)
Code review: get another developer to look at the code
Static code analysis: this is automated, and it's the checking of the code against some predefined standards without running it.
